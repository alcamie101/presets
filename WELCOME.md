# Welcome to Notion's Community Presets

This readme is a basic overview of how to use GitHub to upload, download or edit the preset files hosted here.

If you are happy using GitHub, then jump straight to the [Preset readme here](Documentation/Plug-in%20Presets.md) which will outline what our presets are, how to create them, and how to use them. 

## What is GitHub
GitHub is open-source version control system: “open-source” in that it is free to use and develop; “version control”
meaning any changes are documented so anyone can see what was changed and when.  If you follow the link above, you
will find our repository (or repo) - a repository is just a collection of folders and files that constitutes a project.
Anyone can log-in and make changes and work as a mini-community (hence “hub”) - but you don’t need to be a
computer whizz!
## Sign-in
To make changes you'll need to create a (free) GitHub account. 
## Downloading 
### Downloading (for the first time, or a one-off - also known as cloning)
Found a preset you want? Great! You need to download the whole project, rather than just a single preset - go [here](https://github.com/notionmusic/presets) and click "Clone or download"

## Uploading (commit)

## Making a different version (fork)
