If you are happy using GitHub, then jump straight to the [Preset readme here](Plug-in%20Presets.md) which will outline what our presets are, how to create them, and how to use them. 

## What is GitHub
GitHub is open-source version control system: “open-source” in that it is free to use and develop; “version control”
meaning any changes are documented so anyone can see what was changed and when.  If you follow the link above, you
will find our repository (or repo) - a repository is just a collection of folders and files that constitutes a project.
Anyone can log-in and make changes and work as a mini-community (hence “hub”) - but you don’t need to be a
computer whizz!

## Downloading 
Found a preset you want? Great! You need to download the whole project, rather than just a single preset folder - go [here](https://github.com/notionmusic/presets) and click "Clone or download". You then have a choice:
1. Download a zip file
   - This is the easiest method. Once downloaded, unzip and go to presets/Libraries to find the Preset Folder you want to use. Copy the      required Preset Folder into wherever you save your presets (see [here](Plug-in%20Presets.md#preset-locations) for possible save       
   locations)
2. Clone
   - This allows you to save a working copy of this project on your computer, and pull / push any changes made direct from your machine, keeping things up to date. There are a few ways of achieving this, more information can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/). 

## Uploading
To make changes or to upload your presets, you'll need to create a (free) GitHub account. 
Once signed in, go to the [Libraries folder here](Libraries) and click "Upload"
